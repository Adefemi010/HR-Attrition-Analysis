# HR-Attrition-Analysis

Employee attrition is a critical concern for Human Resources (HR) departments as it directly impacts organizational performance and productivity. Understanding the factors that contribute to employee attrition is essential for developing effective retention strategies. This data analysis project, titled "HR Attrition," aims to explore and analyze the various factors influencing employee turnover within a company. This project seeks to identify key patterns and predictors of attrition, providing actionable insights to help the organization improve employee satisfaction and retention rates. 

Through this project, I anticipate gaining a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of the workforce, enabling more informed decision-making and fostering a more engaged and stable work environment.
